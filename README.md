# Cannibal-And-Missionaries
Recreated the classic logic puzzle game "Cannibals and Missionaries" using html, css and javascript. The game involves moving a group of missionaries and cannibals across a river using a boat , without ever leaving the cannibals on majority on either side. The puzzle can be solved in 11 moves!  Good Luck!

The rules:
Please help the 3 cannibals and the 3 missionaries to move to the other side of the lake. Notice that: when there is on one side more cannibals than missionaries, they eat them. Good luck!
